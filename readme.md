# Weather Dashboard 

## Description
A weather dashboard website that uses OpenWeather One Call API to get the current weather and a five daye forecast. The website first shows a page with a header and a search box for the user to enter in a city. If the user types a invalid city they will receive a error alert and the program will not run. Once a valid city has been entered the user will see to sections pop up. One is the current weather for the city and below that is the next five day forecast. If the user enters in another city the current weather and five day forecast updates and the old city becomes a button in a history list. The user is then able to click on any past city they have entered in and have the current weather and five day forecast populate.
